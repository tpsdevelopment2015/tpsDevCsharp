This code sample consists of three problems to solve.

1. GuessingGame:
Write code in GuessingGame.NextGuess() to guess a number between two 
numbers X and Y (inclusive). Your only hint after each guess will be higher, 
lower, or correct. For example, your code should be able to guess the number 
between 1 and 100,000 in 17 or fewer guesses.

2. JumpToConclusions:
Given an array of N elements with each element having a value, write code in 
JumpToConclusions.CalculateCost() to arrive at the Nth element by moving to 
X+1 or X+2 where X is your current position in the array. You must start at 
position 0. Pick the path to the Nth element with the smallest total of values 
of elements along the path. The included file "jump_to_conclusions_boards.txt" 
can be used as input for testing. Arrays will have a length of 1 or greater.

3. WordCounter:
Write code in WordCounter.GetWordCount() to find the unique words and counts of 
occurences of each word. A word is defined as anything separated by one or more 
spaces. Zero length words should be excluded. Words should be case insensitive. 
For example, “Is” and “is” should be counted as two occurences of the same word. 
The included file "The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo.txt" can be used as input for testing.

Only modify the file "CodeSample.cs" and return it to us for evaluation. It is 
not necessary to return the rest of the solution.
